Example Code: XMC1300_CCU8_COMP_PWM

Description of example project
==============================
This example is for CCU8 module, it starts 1 slice of CCU8 for 1 sets of complementary outputs on
Port 0 [1:0] with dead time. The frequency of the PWM is 1Hz. The duty cycle on channel 1 is
33.33% 

Hardware Setup
===============
XMC1300 Bootkit (No other satellite board required)


How to test the application
============================
a. Import the project
b. Compile and flash the application onto the device
c. Run the application.
d. Watch the complementary PWM output at P0.0 and P0.1 with dead time with an oscilloscope.
